(The irony will be in a few months when I'll know the REAL meaning of crying and look back at how laughable this project was)


Last night, at about hour 9 of straight coding doing my CLI project from beginning to end... I hit a glitch that put my code in an infinite loop, and would shut down the IDE. This happened multiple times during that whole hour. Since I was coding through sandbox, I felt like I was in an ironic infinite loop myself having to keep recloning my github, installing the gems, and running the code, only to find that I could not find where the glitch was!

The syntax error kept saying it was in my API file, that it needed another 'end'. I added the end, ran the code

# * poof *

Reclone github
gem install pry
gem install json
gem install httparty
cd file
git remote -v
git status

Fix code according to syntax error
Run code

# * poof! * NOT TODAY!

Reclone github
gem install pry
gem install json
gem install httparty
cd file
git remote -v
git status

Fix code presumably where I think I know where my misyake is, according to syntax error.
Git add .
Git commit
Git push
Git status
Run Code

# *....one guess.... and then some crying
The original syntax error said the problem was in the API file. But I knew it was in the CLI file, since I clearly did not put an end where the loop should have stopped. I had to delete half of the new lines of code I had just inputted, as a way to backtrack where my mistake could have been.

Run code.

Finally, the new syntax error told me it was in the CLI.

You cry out of frustraton. For me, the solution was so close, it was right in front of me.


Reflecting now, 2 weeks later since my first blog post, it has definitely gotten harder as my  brain is pushed to retain more information at an exponential rate. Yet I am still incredibly proud of what I do know so far. I am obsessed with understanding something from front to back. I will ask so many in detail questions. It doesnt help when someone tells me "you don't have to know that yet." I can't look at the whole house yet or even the room we're building, I'm to just focus on how to make the bricks that will go into building the house.

I believe that part of the information block in my head is because I am very nervous and afraid to fail or embarass myself. I put more pressure on myself to absorb the material faster, so everything ends up like my CLI code: *POOF! NOT TODAY!*

I did find my mistake and was able to fix it. The feeling at first was disbelief because I wasn't sure how it happened. I was still thinking the code would fail by executing the infinite loop, and shut down the IDE.

I was so proud of myself. I felt a huge sense of redemption that I can do this. I have a whole day left to study up and review/rewrite my notes as I had wished before pushing forward into the next part of our module.
